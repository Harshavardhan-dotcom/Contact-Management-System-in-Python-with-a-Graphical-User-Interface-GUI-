Code Explanation:
The following sections explain some important parts of the code used in the Contact Management System:

Database Connection:
The project uses SQLite3 to handle database operations, ensuring efficient management of contact information.
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('contact.db')
c = conn.cursor()
Here, a connection to the contact.db database is created, allowing the system to read and write contact data.

Adding Contacts:
A function is created to allow users to add a new contact by inputting their personal details.
def add_contact():
first_name = entry_first_name.get()
last_name = entry_last_name.get()
...
c.execute('INSERT INTO contacts (first_name, last_name, ...) VALUES (?, ?, ...)', ...)
conn.commit()
This function retrieves user input and inserts it into the database using an SQL query.
Updating Contacts:
The system allows updating contact details by double-clicking on a contact and editing the data.
def update_contact():
selected_contact = contact_list.selection()
...
c.execute('UPDATE contacts SET first_name=?, last_name=? WHERE id=?', ...)
conn.commit()
The updated contact details are then saved back to the database.
Deleting Contacts:
A function to delete contacts from the database.
def delete_contact():
selected_contact = contact_list.selection()
...
c.execute('DELETE FROM contacts WHERE id=?', ...)
conn.commit()
